            - The user's favorite muscle groups should be prioritized at least twice per week, with either 2-3 exercises dedicated to it on specific days..
            - Each exercise must start with "- "
            - Include sets and reps in parentheses like "(4 sets: 8-10 reps)"
            - NO additional text, descriptions, or explanations
            - Keep it minimal and clean
            - Do not include any cardio unless the user has specifically requested it.
            - Ensure the plan is feasible given the user's time constraints and equipment access.
            - Ensure the plan is balanced and targets all major muscle groups throughout the week, with emphasis on a favorite if they selected one.
            - Use common exercise names that are widely recognized.
            - Ensure proper punctuation and capitalization.
            - NO days should be empty. For rest days, explicitly write "Rest Day".
